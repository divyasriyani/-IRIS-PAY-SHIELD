Abstract
In this project, a Biometric Authentication system using the Iris biometric authentication method is designed. The approach taken is using the CASIA-Thousand-IRIS dataset and model it using the Deep Convultional Neural Network Architicture, with the minimum image-preprocessing such as resizing with keeping the aspect ratiio and normalization. It is an end-to-end technique without performing segmentaion of the IRIS itself. The results are promising, even without perfroing training on augmentation, the testing accuracy has reached (93.15%). Finally, for the proof of the (biometric authentication system concept) a simple mobile application is designed and the model is deployed on it (IrisRecognizer) as it was exported to it's liter version were default quantization is performed.

Introduction
The science of Cybersecurity has become essential and irreparable in modern life. With the rise of information technology, the fragility and vulnerability also increases. One of the aspects that cybersecurity addresses is the sophisticated kinds of cybercrime and cyberespionage activities, as well as cyber-terror and cyberwar. Another aspect that cybersecurity addresses is Controlling Access for computer resources, with a known framework called: the triple Aâ€™s (AAA) [1] it stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. This report is concerned with the first A: the Authentication part. Simply put, Authentication is when the user provides information to the system that affirm they are who they claim to be. There are three main types of authentication:

Something you know, like a password.
Something you have, like a Universal Serial Bus (USB) key.
Something you are, such as fingerprint or other biometrics.
